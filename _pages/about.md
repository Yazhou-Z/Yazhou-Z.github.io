I am a PhD Candidate at NYU and working on pain and computational neuroscience. (How to pronounce ‚ÄúYazhou‚Äù(ÈõÖÊ¥≤): like ‚ÄúYay-Jo‚Äù)

I am deeply passionate about understanding how the brain works. My research interests include perception, memory and the mechanism of neural disorders.

If you are a potential collaborator with similar interests, feel free to email me at *<a href="mailto: yazhou.laugh@gmail.com">yazhou.laugh@gmail.com</a>*. I am open to discussing my current projects or exploring potential cooperation.
