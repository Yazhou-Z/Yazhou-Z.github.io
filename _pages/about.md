I am a senior student majoring in BME and CS at the University of Hong Kong. In 2023, I am a visiting student at UC Berkeley. I am working on theoretical neuroscience at the [Redwood Theoretical Neuroscience Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). (How to pronounce ‚ÄúYazhou‚Äù(ÈõÖÊ¥≤): like ‚ÄúYa-Joe‚Äù)

I am deeply passionate about understanding how the brain works. My research interests include recognition and attention in visual system, neural manifold learning, face recognition (*Fun fact: Yazhou has face agnosia* üòÜ), and neuromodulation.

If you are a potential collaborator with similar interests, feel free to email me at *<a href="mailto:yazhou@berkeley.edu">yazhou@berkeley.edu</a>*. I am open to discussing my current projects or exploring potential cooperation.
