I am a senior student majoring in BME and CS at the University of Hong Kong. In 2023, I spent a year at the [Redwood Theoretical Neuroscience Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. This fall, I will be a PhD student at NYU, focusing on pain-related computational neuroscience. (How to pronounce ‚ÄúYazhou‚Äù(ÈõÖÊ¥≤): like ‚ÄúYa-Jo‚Äù)

I am deeply passionate about understanding how the brain works. My research interests include perception, memory and the mechanism of neural disorders. I am happy to chat about my ongoing projects on attention modeling, cone mosaic arrangement, and attractor networks. Previously, I worked on EEG decoding for face recognition and MRI analysis for clinical applications.

If you are a potential collaborator with similar interests, feel free to email me at *<a href="mailto: yazhou.laugh@gmail.com">yazhou.laugh@gmail.com</a>*. I am open to discussing my current projects or exploring potential cooperation.
