I'm a junior student majoring in BME and CS at the University of Hong Kong. In 2023, I'm visiting at UC Berkeley. I am working on manifold learning at the [Redwood Theoretical Neuroscience Center](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/). (How to pronounce ‚ÄúYazhou‚Äù: like ‚ÄúYa-Joe‚Äù)

I'm deeply passionate about understanding how the brain works. My research interests include recognition and attention in visual system, neural manifold learning, face recognition (*Fun fact: Yazhou has face agnosia LOL*üòÜ), and neuromodulation. 

If you're a potential collaborator with similar interests, feel free to email me at *<a href="mailto:yazhou@berkeley.edu">yazhou@berkeley.edu</a>*. I'm open to discussing my current projects or exploring potential cooperation.

For freshmen and sophomores interested in neural-related research, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'm excited to meet new people from diverse backgrounds, share my experiences, and potentially start a mentorship.

## Previous Projects

Previously, I worked on face recognition and EEG decoding at the HKU ABC lab under the supervision of Prof. Janet Hsiao, seizure detection collaborating with Dr. Guoyang Liu, contrastive learning for ADHD identification at the University of Alberta under the supervision of Dr. Xinyu Li, biosensor and neuromorphic computing at HKU WISE lab under the supervision of Dr. Shiming Zhang, MRI analysis for neuromodulation outcome prediction at SZU Medical AI lab under the supervision of Prof. Bingsheng Huang.
